Unfortunately my brain decided to just stop writing blog articles about stuff I do. This does not mean that I ever stopped. Oh hell no, I even did too much since I last blogged about my life. Things changed drastically in the last 12 months: moving to Central London to work fulltime, having two cats as well as enjoying life more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s not talk about boring stuff for now, what can you guys expect on here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s sum up some things I want to talk about in the next weeks and months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Java/Javascript/Groovy/’insert your favourite language here’ tips and tricks!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; and CIs like Jenkins, TravisCI or Bamboo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Motivation, Work/Life Balance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gamedev!!!111 and pixelart&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaming and Twitter drama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds interesting? Let’s see what the future holds. See you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>th3_5had0w</name></author><category term="introduction" /><summary type="html">Laziness can be a disease.
